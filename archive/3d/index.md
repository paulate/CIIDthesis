This is a draft!

### How might we teach the basics of 3D modeling for 3D printing in a fun way? 

- How might we make toys to improve 3d making skills?
- How might we get kids excited about engineering?
- In doing all these, how might we help kids indirectly learn the basics of constructive solid geometry?

### Why?

- Makers are the future. Kids are the future!
- Construction toys do not easily lend themselves to teaching subtractive boolean operations (you can unite two blocks to make a house, but can you subtract two blocks to make a doughnut?)
- Building up 3d mental models is challenging but can provide a new way of thinking
- These concepts are useful skills in 2d computer graphics (vectors, e.g. for laser cutting) and in 3d computer graphics (cad modeling, e.g. for 3d printing)


### Project goals

- Observations
    - How do kids learn geometry? What age? 
    - What toys do kids play with that help them develop spatial skills?
    - What tools do teachers use?
- Experimentations
    - Prototype 2D boolean games
    - Prototype 3D boolean games
    - Create narratives
- Creations 
    - Include a platform to transition over to free creation
    - Integrate with existing 3D CAD tools?
    
### Challenges

- How to make this fun? 
    - Puzzle-based game 
    - Narrative-based game
    - Or maybe it's just in the aesthetics?
