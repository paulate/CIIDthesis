This is a draft!

### How might we make physical computing more accessible to students by making interactive tools for teaching and experimentation? 

- How might we create new interaction paradigms in learning physical computing? 
- How might we make learning fun by making dry, technical explanations and documentation interactive and exploratory?
- How might we leverage the interactivity to create a community of students that contribute value to a pool of growing knowledge?

### Why?

- Physical computing is exciting to learn, but the static, dense documentation can be a barrier to entry.
- Learning is enhanced by kinesthetic, visual tools and interactions, and existing digital tools are not using interactivity to their fullest advantages.
- The flow of teaching can be enhanced by active and responsive presentations that can integrate with the physical computing platform itself.


### Project goals

- Observations
    - Different models of teaching physical computing
        - e.g. arduino, M&M @ ciid, haptikit, etc. 
- Find the interaction that's cumbersome in the learning experience. Work on a tool for that interaction. 
- Experiments
    - Comic book model?
    - Multicast class experience?
    - Presentation tool that offers in-line editing of code to demo the device
    - Development platform integrated into the tutorials, so edits can show real-time
    - Community contributions that can offer feedback on the tutorial and highlight tough spots

### Challenges

- Platform should be empowering, should allow people to explore and not be limited by the content within the platform
- The thing I make should not be Another CMS System
