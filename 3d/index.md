# Learning, interactions, and technology

---

I approached my final project with a focus on **learning tools.**

> ## Doing with images makes symbols. 
> â€“ *Alan Kay, 1987*

---

I wanted to apply Kay's insight to my own background, **engineering and technology.**

My own education in engineering was full of challenges and struggles, and I saw the positive impacts of **kinesthetic, hands-on learning.**

#### How can I make engineering and technology more accessible to non-experts?

#### How can I get kids excited about diving into the complexity of these subjects?

#### Draw a bicycle from memory.

#### Conceptualizing 3D mental models: Building with construction toys

#### Developing spatial skills: Learning a vocabulary

#### The next step in construction: digital fabrication

* Steep learning curve for existing CAD
* Cumbersome interactions

Thus, my design challenge:

### How might we teach children the basics of 3d modeling in a fun, playful way that gets them excited about engineering and technology? 

---

#### How can I make 3d modeling more accessible to non-experts by creating new interaction paradigms for creation that are intuitive and unconstrained by existing digital tools?

#### How can I get kids excited about diving into the complexity of 3d modeling and geometry by developing mental models and spatial vocabulary?

I'm taking an experimental approach to the next 7 weeks:

* **User driven**  
e.g. 3D modeling class/workshop, gesture brainstorming

* **Interaction driven**  
e.g. 2D and 3D boolean geometry activities, paper folding as 3d modeling gestures

* **Technology driven**  
e.g. Kinect gesture experiments, CAD camera controller, Open Frameworks

---


I want to keep my **learning goals** in mind. 

* Maximize my own learning
* Construct compelling narratives
* Refine skills in graphic design, aesthetics
* Experiment with browser-based technologies

7 weeks left...

I acknowledge that there's a lot of stuff. Here's some feedback I'm looking for...

- How to structure prototypes for learning
- The best way to approach testing with kids
- If there's a particular focus that's more interesting

---


What I've already done...

* Looked at existing research. 
* Interviewed a middle school design teacher.
* Observed a 6th grade design class.
* Interviewed 2 experts in 3D printing.
