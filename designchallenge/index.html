# Learning, interactions, and technology

---

class:middle 

I approached my final project with a focus on **learning tools.**

> ## Doing with images makes symbols. 
> â€“ *Alan Kay, 1987*

---

I wanted to apply Kay's insight to my own background, **engineering and technology.**

My own education in engineering was full of challenges and struggles, and I saw the positive impacts of **kinesthetic, hands-on learning.**

> #### How can I get kids excited about diving into the complexity of these subjects?

#### Draw a bicycle from memory.

<!-- * Construction toys can't help with all the aspects vocabulary of 3D modeling
* Understanding how parts can make a whole, building blocks of construction
* What about subtraction?

I think we want a diagram here.  -->

Thus, my design challenge:

### How might we teach children the basics of 3d modeling in a fun, playful way that gets them excited about engineering and technology?

> #### How can I make 3d modeling more accessible to non-experts by creating new interaction paradigms for creation that are intuitive and unconstrained by existing digital tools?

> #### How can I get kids excited about diving into the complexity of 3d modeling and geometry by developing mental models and spatial vocabulary?

I'm taking an experimental approach to the next 7 weeks:

> * **User driven**  
> e.g. 3D modeling class/workshop, gesture brainstorming

> * **Interaction driven**  
> e.g. 2D and 3D boolean geometry activities, paper folding as 3d modeling gestures

> * **Technology driven**  
> e.g. Kinect gesture experiments, CAD camera controller, Open Frameworks

---
class:middle

I want to keep my **learning goals** in mind. 

* Maximize my own learning
* Construct compelling narratives
* Refine skills in graphic design, aesthetics
* Experiment with browser-based technologies

7 weeks left...

class:middle

I acknowledge that there's a lot of stuff. Here's some feedback I'm looking for...

- How to structure prototypes for learning
- The best way to approach testing with kids
- Techniques for planning and acquiring user research
- If there's a particular focus that's more interesting

class:middle

What I've already done...

* Looked at existing research. 
* Interviewed a middle school design teacher.
* Observed a 6th grade design class.
* Interviewed 2 experts in 3D printing.
