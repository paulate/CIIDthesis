These were initial thoughts for the [3D Making]({{ site.baseurl }}/3d) direction. Check out the [page]({{ site.baseurl }}/3d) for the latest deets.

### [How might we help children learn and create accurate 3d mental models by allowing them to create complex 3d mechanisms or structures?]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/2409-mentalmodel.jpg)


<!-- Tasks

1. Technology/ physical setup of bringing 3d objects into 2d digital world
2. Gameplay that is fun for kids
3. Structure of game that teaches kids to explore/comprehend 3d space
4. Interface/ interaction on screen
  -->

#####FEARS

1. Technology could be hard and frustrating
2. Kids might not like it in the end. It has to be fun...
3. I won't be able to test my hypothesis: "This will improve kids' ability to conceptualize in 3d"
4. Designing a game is hard. Co-create with children?
5. Need a lot of child development / psychology research


#####HOPES

1. kids kids kids
2. Perhaps learn some WebGL and Unity
3. This will be fun to show off during exhibition


##### Feedback
- Zoom out. Is there a better way to accomplish this? 
- How might we support development of spatial reasoning? 
- Check out Monument Valley
- Education focused
- This is a design project. Find the MVP. You have the "How." 
- This is a tired space. 
- Why are 3D mental models important? Provide quotes.
- You're giving people a new ability. 
- Test on your classmates games that you find. See how people solve it, what processes they apply. 
- Don't start from the technology. What's the simplest / least technical solution you can implement?
- Research when people start developing spatial awareness? Observe kids' perception of 3d space. 
- Aptitude tests each time you meet with the user group
- 3D is difficult when you're working on 3D in a 2D world... 
- test with school. 
- read about montessori education
- littlebits is a collection of components
