### From Convivial Toolbox
- Analyze feedback ASAP

### From Simona

Refine the graph:
- Is it expert <-> beginner?
- Is it grown-ups <-> kids? 

Inspirations, people
- Valby library & fablab
- ART+COM (Joachim)
- Sergio
- Haiyan
- Reach out to families and parents
- Loci

Decide context:
- Is it for kids at school?
- Families and kids at home?
- Define the target age, perhaps ages 10-12 is who we can target with the tools we have available to us now, but if you are to create new paradigms, maybe you can go earlier

Semi-measurable results:
- Do kids produce more objects?
- Do kids produce more variety of objects? Or more complex objects?

When approaching users, craft your words carefully.
- Be patient and open with kids!
- First engage the teachers, visit for 1-2 days with no plan, just to observe, so I can better integrate my prototype into the context of the school.
- Be curious about who the teachers are, what they're teaching. Don't take too much of their time at first. 
    - But learn what topics are being taught, and be inspired and constrained by these topics. For example, if they're doing a unit on dinosaurs, why not integrate your 3d modeling with dinosaurs!
    - That way you build upon their subjects, and get genuine feedback, not from some artificial insertion into the class day
    
Zoom out / do more bisociation / metaphor across different subjects
- Look at how surgeons operate brain surgery remotely
- Who needs functional, remote 3d modeling? 
- What contexts require indirect manipulation?

Allow these insights to narrow your focus in what to 3d model. Is it dinosaurs? Is it to learn more about geometry? Is it humans?
