Sorted from concepts -> terms -> actions -> higher-level actions 

![bodystorming]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bodystorming-1.jpg)

I found these words particularly interesting. 

#### Good idea
In the software, it was a good idea to lock shapes. Why is this a good idea? Is it a good idea outside of the software? How can a tool express suggestions or "good ideas" to users? Should the user have to be told what "good ideas" are?

#### Specific CAD tools
- Work plane
- Sketch mode 
- Handles

The second four were all tools that were very specific to the 3D modeling software. (Actually, measuring tape is obviously more generic...) These terms don't exist when you're sculpting something out of clay, for example.

#### Terms with ambition
- Share
- Create

I like these words because they imply actions that extend beyond the tool.
