# Learning, education, and technology

That was my starting point. I stand for: 

- Living with intent
- Enabling conscious creation
- Designing for less
- Understanding the world from many perspectives
- Freedom of choice

As a designer, I believe I am in a unique position to enable people to create beauty & meaning in their lives. 

I believe in my role to empower people to express themselves freely. I want to enable choice by giving people access to knowledge.

Learning, education, and technology was my starting point because, probably like you, I've been shaped by the knowledge available to me and the ways and methods I was taught. Interaction design is a field that sits right at the intersection of learning and technology and humans. So in some ways, my starting point was very broad. I rummaged through a list of ideas I keep, and came up with two directions that were relevant to my experience in engineering and science.

- [3D Making]({{site.baseurl}}/3d)
- [Interactive Science]({{site.baseurl}}/archive/interactivescience)

I've continued on with the [3D Making]({{site.baseurl}}/3d) direction since then.

<!-- Probably like you, I've experienced first hand how learning can impact lives and change the world. Probably like you, I've struggled with my own education, have been bummed out by poor methods of teaching and communication, failed many times because of environments or contexts that could have been designed so much better.
