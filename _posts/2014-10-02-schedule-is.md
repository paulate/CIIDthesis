## People centered research goals

*   Students (CIID, workshop)
    *   3-4 students to test each prototype (3)
*   Teachers (CIID, workshop, tech)
    *   1-2 teachers to test each prototype (3)
*   Researchers/technologists who teach occasionally
    *   1-2 to test and short interview

## Prototype test goals

These are not the only questions I will focus on. Just ones I want to keep in mind

* Test 1
    *   What physical computing tools?
* Test 2
    *   What interactions to focus on? 
* Test 3
    *   Is it effective? 
    *   Is it fun? 
    *   Is the interface intuitive?
