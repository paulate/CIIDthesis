## Insights

### Values of teaching:
1. Learning to problem solve
2. Understanding the design process and why this structure is useful
3. Developing creativity and confidence 

### A classroom setting involves organization of different skills at different levels
> There are a huge range in the kids' technological skills. Some have never even used a computer. We paired her with a very computer savvy classmate who could help her along the way.

> "Brain, Board, Buddy: Ask these things first before you ask the teacher!"

### Perspective, 3D construction, and 3D modeling are hard concepts to grasp for grades 6-8
> 3D is challenging, we've played with it, but 3D is hard

### Independence and curiosity are traits that are inherent in some children, but are trained and practiced for others. 
> It takes some kids 3 years to stop needing to be handheld by the teacher...

> We provide a lot of scaffolding for grade 6. We have less scaffolding for grade 7. Then in grade 8, 9, 10 we ask them to be more independent. 

### Teachers appropriate tools to fit education structure, creating their own symbols/language.
> We use Google Presentation for our agendas, but we've had to create special "corner folds" to assign different slides to different teaching blocks. 

### Variety of methods used to explain the same process.
> There will be a video, a step-by-step list and demonstration, and a checklist, so that kids can follow any one of these (or multiple) depending on their preference of learning.
