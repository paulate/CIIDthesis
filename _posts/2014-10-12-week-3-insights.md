#### Create this feedback confidence loop as quickly as possible. Children are inherent designers, they'll iterate over their creations. Get this feedback loop of imagining, shaping, touching.

<!-- How might kids learn 3d modeling in a fun and physical way that gets them engaged and inspired to build complex creations? 

How can I make 3d modeling more accessible to non-experts by creating new interaction paradigms for creation that are intuitive and unconstrained by existing digital tools?

How can I get kids excited about diving into the complexity of 3d modeling and geometry by developing mental models and spatial vocabulary?

My final project is about teaching kids 3d modeling in a fun and physical way. For me, this is about making 3D modeling more accessible to beginners, giving kids a new way of thinking, and also about bridging the tangible and digital. I'm in the brainstorming phase of my project, and I'd be very interested in having a conversation about children and interaction design. -->
## Key teaching: create complex things out of simple shapes. 


## Insight: Gestures need to be supplemented with a physical tool. 
> "Imagine waving your arms around for 8 hours." - Dushan

## Insight: Problems of scale on screen. 
> "That looks way bigger than 4mm..." - Paal 

## Insight: Construct an environment or context that motivates the build. A tiny amount of gamification...
> What's hard about LDD (Lego Digital Design) is the blank slate. Special bricks e.g. minifigs are the inspiration for creations.  Minecraft and carefully constructed guidance and goals. Limit amount of tools until they push the boundaries, then allow them to break through the boundaries. With Minecraft everyone starts at the same level. - Sid

## Opportunity: A platform that helps kids share and teach others 3d modeling.
> Have the platform allow users to teach - sharing knowledge is fun and important and pushes kids to do more. Share not just the model but how it was made. - Sid

## Opportunity: Immortalize kids' creations via 3d printing.
> 90% of the kids don't like destroying their creations, they don't break their construction apart in order to build again. - Sid
