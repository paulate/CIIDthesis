| When:     | Week 7, 19 Nov 2014|
| Where:    | Coding Pirates KBH |
| Records:  | Audio, Video, Screen Recording |
| Who: | Kids 6-12 | 

### Quotes
> "I like that I can make things 3D without using a pencil and without using a mouse." - J, 12 years old.

> "Really awesome."

> "This is really next gen gaming."

### New questions: 
- What is the vision? 
	- Demonstrate the possibilities
		- Build vertically
		- Replicate patterns
		- Anything can be made out of simple shapes
- How to implement teaching of CAD vocabulary?
	- Provide on-screen cues during interaction
- Is it really cool because of the technology used, or is it really cool because it's a new way of building? 
	- Encourage building without providing "goals" of what to build
	- Goals are to expand building possibilities as much as possible
	- Make these instructions clear and compelling

### Insights
- Age range: 8-12
- When a 6-yo tried it: He was not very engaged by it, perhaps the magic isn't real enough - or the age range is just too young!


#### Technical insights
- Tool is still challenging because of its glitches. 
- It's "cool" because of the technology.  
- Continue to develop "plane" of building
#### Building insights
- Building challenges were not effective. Kids did not build; they only tried out demo and then stopped when they reached the demo's limit, rather than experimenting more. (The adults experimented much more.)
- "I would like to build from scratch, because then you don't get told what to build."
- "I'd build a house."
- "I don't know what I'm building, something good."

#### Interaction insights
- Keep the gestures. They are magic. They are scalable. 
- People often gestured over the pieces, not the leap motion. 
- Two fingers to gesture scaling is too cumbersome. Make it more natural - use 5 features. 

### Next time
- Have a 3d printed version of something they could potentially build in the classroom.


## Technical improvements
- Non-mirrored view without blocking view
- Undo
- Scale, maybe.
- 5 finger gesture instead of 2 finger
- Color, maybe.
- Gesture
