## Insights

#### The dream is to not use a mouse for creating 3d models.
> Something still tangible but a lot easier to use.

#### Good software is forgiving and enabling

> Solidworks is much better than (older CAD tools). It's better in usability, you can convert from surfaces to solids easily, you can create technical drawings and molds. It has a forgiving margin of error; it will still make parts if you have errors. 

#### Existing software still has a large learning curve

See the reflection worksheet below; Martino slowly became happier with Solidworks over time, but the first time use case is always sad. 

## Replicating a model
