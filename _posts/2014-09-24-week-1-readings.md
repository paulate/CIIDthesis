- Mindstorms by Seymour Papert

Kay and Papert share many ideas about using the computer to positively impact cognitive development in children, when the tool is designed correctly. 

> It is in the nature of tools and man that learning to use tools reshapes us.

Kay & Papert argue that the computer is not only a tool, but a medium for learning, and we can be immersed in this world in order to develop new ways of thinking. 

> The ability to "read" a medium means you can access materials and tools created by others. The ability to "write" in a medium means you can generate materials and tools for others. You must have both to be literate.

### Doing with Images makes Symbols

> It is best to learn something kinesthetically, then iconically, and finally the intuitive knowledge will allow the more powerful but less vivit symbolic processes to work at their strongest. 

| enactive | know where you are, manipulate            |
| iconic   | recognize, compare, configure, concrete   |
| symbolic | tie together long chains of reasoning, abstract | 

> We have the object first, and then the desire second. 

### Sage advice

> Because it is in part the duty of consciousness to represent ourselves to ourselves as simply as possible, we should sorely distrust our commonsense self view.
