- [The key to growth? Race with the machines](http://www.ted.com/talks/erik_brynjolfsson_the_key_to_growth_race_em_with_em_the_machines/transcript?language=en) by Erik Brynjolfsson
- [Failure of Inquiry-Based Teaching](http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf) A 2006 paper critical of unguided, experimental learning.

Brynjolfsson describes the new machine age. In his talk, growth is a built-in metric for success. He argues that the new machine age should embrace collaboration between humans and machines. 
> The new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. It's mind not matter, brain not brawn, ideas not things.

Kay and Papert share many ideas about using the computer to positively impact cognitive development in children, when the tool is designed correctly. 

> It is in the nature of tools and man that learning to use tools reshapes us.

Kay & Papert argue that the computer is not only a tool, but a medium for learning, and we can be immersed in this world in order to develop new ways of thinking. 

> The ability to "read" a medium means you can access materials and tools created by others. The ability to "write" in a medium means you can generate materials and tools for others. You must have both to be literate.

### Doing with Images makes Symbols

> It is best to learn something kinesthetically, then iconically, and finally the intuitive knowledge will allow the more powerful but less vivit symbolic processes to work at their strongest. 

| enactive | know where you are, manipulate            |
| iconic   | recognize, compare, configure, concrete   |
| symbolic | tie together long chains of reasoning, abstract | 

> We have the object first, and then the desire second. 

### Sage advice

> Because it is in part the duty of consciousness to represent ourselves to ourselves as simply as possible, we should sorely distrust our commonsense self view.
