## Insights

### Try many different approaches to teaching the same thing. 
> "I vary methods of learning because it's boring otherwise. It also motivates the students. Also, kids learn in different ways. I would vary methods of analyzing or viewing a book between chapters"

### She believes kids learn by constructing their own knowledge about information given to them. 
> "I was taught at a crazy school where the teachers thought that the knowledge could just be poured into our heads and we would retain it."

### Classroom is limited and constrained by external forces, so an exploratory tool may best be placed outside of this context
> "Education is influenced by political waves and economic crises. If there are financial crises, there will be a high demand for practical knowledge and if the economy is stable then there will be more room for the arts to flourish."

## Important factors in teaching for Mette:
