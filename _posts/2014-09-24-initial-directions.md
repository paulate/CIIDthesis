# How might we ... 

- [Help children learn and create accurate 3d mental models by allowing them to create complex 3d mechanisms or structures?]({{ site.baseurl}} /images/2409-mentalmodel.jpg)

- [Help scientists and researches communicate their ideas in clear and compelling ways through the use of current media?]({{ site.baseurl}} /images/2409-researchcommunication.jpg)

- [Close the gap between scientists and tinkerers by reinventing the research paper as a tool for experimentation?]({{ site.baseurl}} /images/2409-researchexp.jpg)

- [Create new and meaningful ways of giving music as gifts?]({{ site.baseurl}} /images/2409-music.jpg)

- [Make sustainability more inherent in maker culture by designing and sharing new processe for using plastic bags as a material?]({{ site.baseurl}} /images/2409-plastic.jpg)

## Hopes and fears

#### 3D Mental Model Game

#####FEARS

1. Technology could be hard and frustrating
2. Kids might not like it in the end. It has to be fun...
3. I won't be able to test my hypothesis: "This will improve kids' ability to conceptualize in 3d"
4. Designing a game is hard. Co-create with children?
5. Need a lot of child development / psychology research


#####HOPES

1. kids kids kids
2. Perhaps learn some WebGL and Unity
3. This will be fun to show off during exhibition


#### Interactive / Visual Research

#####FEARS

1. Researchers might not like it. Written medium conveys abstractions that images cannot.
2. Tinkerers/makers might not like it. They like their Instructables.
3. Difficult to design tools for visualizing research / communicating it clearly.[^1]
4. Difficult to craft a story with this project that is compelling to mainstream.[^2]
6. Need to research publication standards, why people publish, etc.

[^1]: (see: powerpoint templates) (They shouldn't just be templates. They should teach people about graphic design principles.)

[^2]: It is more specific to the audience of researchers, nerdy makers. (Because people think research papers are *boring*) (I need to show a clear impact / benefit of making research more visual, e.g. Raureif's [before]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2409-Raureif1.png) and [after]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2409-Raureif2.jpg))


#####HOPES

1. It's a tool I can create for myself
2. Learn more web programming, data over web
3. Learn more graphic design 
4. Fun information architecture challenge
5. This perhaps has the greater impact and can be more of a starting point to continue beyond CIID

## Topics

Roughly in order of importance for final project... 

- Learning
- Design education, design tools for communications
- Academia communications
- <s>Sustainability in DIY culture</s>
- <s>Sharing culture, free/open culture</s>
- <s>Music</s>
