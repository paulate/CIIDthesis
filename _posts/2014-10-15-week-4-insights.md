## How might kids learn 3d modeling in a fun and physical way that gets them engaged and inspired to build complex creations? 

[![vis]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vis-2.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vis-2.jpg)

## Goals

-   **making 3d modeling more accessible to non-experts**  
    *closing the conÔ¨Ådence feedback loop*
-   **giving kids a new way of thinking**  
    *anything can be made out of simple shapes*  
-   **bridging the tangible and the digital**
-   **inspiring kids with creativity**  
    *provide goals to build towards*
    


## Insights

-   **2D to 3D**  
    *Physical interface can allow for fun transitions between these realms*  
-   **CAD modeling over mesh/animation modeling**  
    *These are very different approaches to 3D modeling, and the goal is to teach the former for 3D printing*
-   **Adventure over puzzle**  
    *Although puzzles can be fun, adventure allows for more freedom in building*
