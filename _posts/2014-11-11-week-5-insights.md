# TADCAD! (working title)
[![vis]({{site.baseurl}}/images/week5-insight.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/week5-insight.jpg)

TADCAD (Tangible aided design [for] computer aided design, or, little bit of cad) is a product and platform for learning 3d modeling in a fun and physical way. 

- Who: 
    - Kids, 7-11
- What: 
    - Software on your computer which connects to a camera and a 3d printer.
- How: 
    - Tadcad works with a combination of guided play and free build. They must 3d print pieces in order to continue building more creations. The pieces are uniquely marked to be recognized by computer vision and the on-screen 3d model appears augmented in reality. The 3d model is exported to the 3d printer, and after printed, is ready to be built upon again. 

#### Prototype: 
Vuforia SDK (AR package) + Unity + Unity to STL + Cura + Ultimaker

#### Gameplay: 
Kids start with a blank slate and are guided through the steps and vocabulary of 3d modeling. They must *sketch* a square that gets printed into a flat square plate, then learn to *extrude* that square plate into a rectangular prism, etc. 

#### Environment: 
A future home environment in which 3d printer technology has become faster and more affordable, so the feedback loop of imagining-modeling-printing can be tightened.

- Question: Collaboration in classroom environments? 

#### Prototype goals:
- Learn how to print building blocks 
- Develop vocabularies (sketch, extrude, revolve, scale, replicate, subtract?)
- Show gamification of 3d modeling (Build a sword, bracelet, or pet)

#### Additional goals:
- <s>Allow for customization/ painting?</s>
- Sharing

#### TODO:

- Make a principles chart
- Catchier names
- Screens of guided play
- Storyboard of free play
- Print building blocks with markers  


#### Testing questions

- (remember that you can build the first tech steps as a proof of concept, to get insight into the other possibilities of interactions)
- Have kids play with tools they didn't necessarily build (for classroom or other context)
- Do they want to skip steps after learning? How would they do it? 
- Test for possible further interactions with the technology
- How much coaxing do they really need to spark their imagination?
