## Insights

#### The dream is to be able to replicate any physical creation in a 3D printer.
Let's not use software for creating 3d objects.

> "There is this dream of the Xerox of 3D printing, to make an exact copy of an object."

> It takes a lot of thought to visualize stuff in 3D. Building stuff by hand is way faster than building stuff by mouse. I'd rather manipulate a piece of clay than use the software. 

#### Existing 3d modeling software is cumbersome
> 123D is really basic. I use it because it's free and fairly straightforward. But it's full of bugs. The UI doesn't make sense. 

> Solidworks has a steep learning curve. 

#### Learning how to use software is a combination of video tutorials and hacking around.

Peter uses James Bruton's YouTube tutorials. 

> "This is when I just start hacking around. i'm pretty sure that there's a better way to do this, i just don't know it." 

## Replicating a model

#### Many interactions are superfluous and seem to limit creativity of expression.

1. draw rectangle
2. type in dimensions
3. draw another rectangle
4. delete rectangle 
5. draw another rectangle
6. rotate view
7. select parts to keep
8. extrude
9. draw circle on the sketch
10. draw the circle on midpoint of edge
11. draw another circle on the sketch
12. extrude both circles
13. rotate
14. create lots of lines to cut the part
15. extrude the cut part
16. rotate, create a 2d shape to cut the part again
17. get the center of the rectangle by drawing diagonals
18. circle at the center
19. extrude the circle
20. delete all unncessary lines

#### Other terms used
- Draw a square
- Draw inside the sketch
- Draw inside the grid (separate "mode" than drawing inside the sketch)
