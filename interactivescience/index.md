This is a draft!

### How might we make science more accessible to young students by making interactive tools for scientific experimentation? 

- How might we create new interaction paradigms in learning science in the classrom? 
- How might we make learning science more fun by making dry, technical explanations interactive and exploratory?
- How might we leverage the interactivity to create a community of students that contribute value to a pool of growing knowledge?

### Why?

- Textbooks and papers are static, cumbersome approaches to learning
- Learning is enhanced by kinesthetic, visual tools and interactions, and existing digital tools are not using interactivity to their fullest advantages
- Learning on a digital platform can be adaptive, changing to a specific student's needs and growing as more students interact with the system


### Project goals

- Observations
    - How do kids learn science?
    - How do kids use digital platforms? 
    - What are kids' homework assignments? 
    - How do kids complete their homework?
    - How do kids conduct scientific experiments?
    - How do scientists communicate their work?
    - How do scientists visualize their work?
    - How do teachers teach science experiments?
- Find the interaction that's cumbersome in the learning experience. Work on a tool for that interaction. 

### Challenges

- I need to narrow down my scope (what experiment? what user? for teachers? for students? for scientists? what's the problem here? what content?).
- Platform should be empowering, should allow children to explore and not be limited by the content within the platform
- The thing I make should not be Another CMS System
